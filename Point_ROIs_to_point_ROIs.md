# Shortest distance between one set of point ROIs to another set of point ROIs
### Object 1 = a set of points (multipoints), Object 2 = another set of points (multipoints)

Following image shows points selected with a multipoint tool in ImageJ and added as the 1st entry in the ROI Manager.

Another set of points are also added to the ROI Manager as the second entry.

Goal is to find the shortest distance of each point in set 1 to the nearest point in set 2.
