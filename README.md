# ImageJ/Fiji macros for measuring shortest distance between two sets of objects
A variety of open-source (e.g. QuPath) and commerical (e.g. Imaris) image analysis softwares implement ways to measure the shortest distance between two sets of objects. 

This functionality was missing (as far as I know in 2018 when I wrote these macros!) in ImageJ/Fiji, one of the most widely-used image analayis software by the biomedical community.   

Therefore, I wrote a series of four ImageJ/Fiji macros to measure shortest distances between:
1. [Point ROIs to 2D ROIs](Point_ROIs_to_2D_ROIs.md)
2. [Point ROIs to line ROIs](Point_ROIs_to_line_ROIs.md)
3. [Point ROIs to point ROIs](Point_ROIs_to_point_ROIs.md)
4. [2D ROIs to 2D ROIs](2D_ROIs_to_2D_ROIs.md)
