A variety of open-source and commerical image analysis softwares implement ways to measure the shortest distance between two sets of objects. 

This functionality was missing in ImageJ/Fiji, one of the most widely-used image analayis software by the biomedical community.   

Therefore, I wrote a series of three ImageJ macros to measure shorest distance between:
1. Point ROIs to 2D ROIs
2. Point ROIs to line ROIs
3. Point ROIs to point ROIs
4. 2D ROIs to 2D ROIs
